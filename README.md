## Installed Dependencies
In this project, I installed dependencies that would help me in building a workable site.  Below are the dependencies installed (with installation setup to drop in terminal). I'm using Vite, so please install as written:

-React
# npm create vite. (this setup will walk you through various installs.)

-React Dom
npm i react-dom
# This install will help when trying to render REACT components to the web browser.

-React Router Dom
npm i react-router-dom
# This install imports a library to assist in routing/navigation REACT applications.

-Framer Motion
npm i framer-motion
# This install imports a library into the REACT project, allowing motion components for animations

## Build Project
In this project, I used Tailwind CSS to help build/style the user interface.  The framework allowed me to use utility classes for individual CSS properties. To install Tailwind CSS use: npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

## Tests
To make sure my project was running correctly, I tested several components such as my AnimalModal.jsx and Animal.jsx.  These files hold various information to allow my site to run smoothly.

## Live Site
I pushed my completed and error-free site to GitHub and created a live site using Nelify.  Please check it out https://loviespetcenter.netlify.app.
